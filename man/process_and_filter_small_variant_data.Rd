\title{Process and filter small variant data-frame to requirements}
\usage{
process_and_filter_small_variant_data(small_variant_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{small_variant_df}{Data-frame of small variants}
}
\value{
processed and filtered data frame
}
\description{
Processes small-variant data to comply with requirements for
further analysis. The function:

\enumerate{
  \item filters for variants that:
    \itemize{
      \item have a consequence in a pre-defined list (see details)
      \item are present with depth > 0
    }
  \item extracts NP ID and protein information from the P Dot-notation column
  \item adds columns to faciliate addition of annotation data
}
}
\details{
The following variant consequences are currently included:
\itemize{
 \item frameshift_variant
 \item inframe_deletion
 \item inframe_insertion
 \item missense_variant
 \item missense_variant:splice_region_variant
 \item splice_acceptor_variant
 \item splice_donor_variant
 \item splice_donor_variant:intron_variant
 \item start_lost
 \item stop_gained
 \item stop_gained:splice_region_variant
 \item stop_lost
}
}
